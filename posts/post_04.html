  I was recently looking into a production issue that had to do with time zones.  
  In order to accurately debug it I had to set the time on my machine to UTC. 
  <br /><br />
  This is how I changed it on OSX Snow Leopard:
  <div class="terminal">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime</div>
  <br />
  Once your done change it back:
  <div class="terminal">$ sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime</div>
