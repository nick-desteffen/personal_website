HTML5 Speech Synthesis API Tips
<div>
  <p>
    The HTML5 Speech Synthesis API isn't widely supported,
    but it is something cool to play with and can be useful.
    It is supported only in Chrome and Safari.  For a recent
    prototype feature I used it.  It is definitely still pretty
    beta. The goal of this post is to give some pointers when using
    it, if you choose to.
  </p>
  <h2>Detecting Support</h2>
  <p>
    If you are going to do anything with Speech Synthesis you
    are probably going to want to enable it only if your user's
    browser supports it.
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: javascript;">
    supportsSpeechSynthesis = function (){
      return 'speechSynthesis' in window
    }
    supportsSpeechSynthesis() // true or false
  </pre>
  <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Using the API is actually really simple. Open your javascript console and try it out.
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: javascript;">
    phrase = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    audio = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(phrase)
    window.speechSynthesis.speak(audio)
  </pre>
  <h2>Chrome Bugs</h2>
  <p>
    There is a <a href='https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=335907' target='_blank'>known bug in Chrome</a>
    that causes the speech synthesis to stop working if you use text greater
    than ~ 300 characters.  The only way to get to start working again is to
    restart Chrome. The simple solution is to split up your text into sentences.
    This actually works out for the better, since there will be a larger gap
    between the sentences and it sounds more natural.
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: javascript;">
    phrase = "\
    Oak is strong and also gives shade.\
    Cats and dogs each hate the other.\
    The pipe began to rust while new.\
    Open the crate but don't break the glass.\
    Add the sum to the product of these three.\
    Thieves who rob friends deserve jail.\
    The ripe taste of cheese improves with age.\
    Act on these orders with great speed.\
    The hog crawled under the high fence.\
    Move the vat over the hot fire.\
    "

    sentences = phrase.split(".")
    for (i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
      sentence = sentences[i]
      audio = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(sentence)
      window.speechSynthesis.speak(audio)
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    This works well, however as a safeguard you might want
    to make sure none of your sentences go over
    the limit.  If any do break them up!
  </p>
  <h2>Pausing and Resuming</h2>
  <p>
    The API supports stopping, pausing, and resuming.
    Safari will resume at the beginning of the current
    SpeechSynthesisUtterance object whereas
    chrome will resume where it left off.
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: javascript;">
    window.speechSynthesis.pause()
    window.speechSynthesis.resume()
    window.speechSynthesis.stop()
  </pre>
  <p>
    I've found that to get everything to work consistently sometimes you have to
    pause and resume it once or twice at the beginning of playback.
