<p>
  This post will discuss building a backend API wrapper using
  <a href="https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus" target="_blank">Typhoeus</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/solnic/virtus" target="_blank">Virtus</a>.  As a project gets more complex
  service oriented architecture allows you to split out your application into more managanable components.
  This makes deployment simpler however it becomes more difficult to work with your data.  Javascript front
  end frameworks like Backbone.js and Ember.js are designed to consume REST APIs easily, this is great if you are
  building a Javascript application.  If you need to connect via Ruby you are going to want an easy way of working with your data.

  By following conventions you can build a simple mixin and you'll be set.    By including the Virtus module in a basic ruby class you can define attributes using it's DSL and
  you'll get automatic type cohersion when you instantiate a new object.

1.) Virtus object example
2.) Basic wrapper
3.) ActiveModelSerializers
4.) Integrate ActiveModel
5.) Hashie as basic alternative for show & index
6.) Link to applications

<h2>Virtus</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/solnic/virtus" target="_blank">https://github.com/solnic/virtus</a>
  Virtus is a gem that was extracted from the <a href='http://datamapper.org/' target="_blank">DataMapper</a> gem. It provides the ability to define attributes on a
  class with automatic type coersion.

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">
    class User
      include Virtus.model

      attribute :id,        Integer
      attribute :name,      String
      attribute :email,     String
      attribute :age,       Integer
      attribute :addresses, Array[Address]
    end

    class Address
      include Virtus.model

      attribute :id,       Integer
      attribute :street,   String
      attribute :city,     String
      attribute :state,    String
      attribute :zip_code, String
    end
  </pre>
  <pre class="brush: ruby;">
    data = {
      id: 1,
      name: "Nick",
      email: "nick@gmail.com",
      age: 33,
      addresses: [{
        id: 1,
        street: "1234 Main St.",
        city: "Chicago",
        state: "IL",
        zip_code: "60640"
      }, {
        id: 2,
        street: "555 Park Ave.",
        city: "New York",
        state: "NY",
        zip_code: "10103"
      }]
    }

    user = User.new(data)
  </pre>
</p>

<h2>ActiveModel::Serializers</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers" target="_blank">https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers</a>
  <pre class="brush: ruby;">
    class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer

      attributes :id, :first_name, :last_name, :email, :auth_token

      has_many :addresses

    end
  </pre>
</p>

<h2>Typhoeus</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus" target="_blank">https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus</a>
  When building your API you don't have to use Typhoeus, however it is very easy to work with.
