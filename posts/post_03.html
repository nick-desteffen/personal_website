  If you are working on several projects that are all deployed on <a href='http://www.engineyard.com/products/appcloud' target="_blank">EngineYard AppCloud</a> managing deployments can be a bit tricky.  
  <br /><br />
  When you first deploy an application using the <a href='https://github.com/engineyard/engineyard' target='_blank'>engineyard gem</a> you authenticate using your email and password.  
  A file named <span class="file_path">.eyrc</span> containing an API token is then generated in your home directory.  
  Each deployment the gem reads the environment variable <strong>ENV['EYRC']</strong>, this contains the location of the .eyrc file.
  EngineYard <a href="http://docs.engineyard.com/deployment-faqs.html" target="_blank">recommends</a> renaming the .eyrc file and using aliases to change update the environment variable with the location of the renamed file for account you are deploying.
  <br /><br />
  My solution to this problem was to move the .eyrc right into the source code.  I then wrote a rake task to handle deployments. 
  Each task in the Rakefile first calls <strong>:set_eyrc</strong> which just updates the environment variable with with the path of the .eyrc file stored in the project.
  <br /><br />
  With this approach everybody working on your project can deploy without setting up aliases on their machine (provided their public key is on the server being deployed to).
  <br /><br />
  Another thing I did to ease deployments was move our Chef Deploy recipes into the project under the directory <span class="file_path">/ey-cloud-recipes</span>, this way it is versioned and can be updated using the same system for multiple accounts.
  <br /><br />
  I've included the Rakefile below.<br /><br />
  <span class="file_path">/config/.eyrc</span>
  <pre class="brush: ruby;">
    --- 
    api_token: YOUR_API_TOKEN
  </pre>
