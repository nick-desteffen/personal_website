<h1>Who is Nick?</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Nick. I live in Chicago, Illinois and I've been doing web development for over 10 years. I started out programming in Java/J2EE and moved into Ruby / Rails about 5 years ago. The last couple of years I've put on a number of additional hats and started doing some systems administration as well as jQuery, Backbone.js, and CSS.</p>
<p>I am currently working at <%= link_to "BenchPrep", "https://benchprep.com", :target => "_blank" %> and am also a co-founder and lead developer of <%= link_to "WisePatient", wisepatient_path %> which was acquired by <%= link_to "Sharecare Inc.", "http://www.sharecare.com", target: "_blank" %> in early 2012.</p>
<p>Some of my hobbies include Camping &amp; Hiking, Astronomy, Board Games, Biking, Computer Gaming, and Homebrewing.</p>
